# Example Run Artifacts (Review-Only)

This folder contains **static, review-only example outputs** that mirror the
expected structure of an EDA run. The artifacts are **synthetic** and were
**not generated by executing the pipeline** in this repo. They exist so reviewers
can inspect the expected folder layout and sample content without running the
pipeline.

## Notes

- `*_sample.csv` files are lightweight stand-ins for the `*.parquet` outputs
  described in `docs/eda/data-dictionary.md`.
- `metadata.yaml` mirrors the structure emitted by the EDA pipeline, populated
  with small synthetic counts for demonstration.
- `run_log.txt` is an illustrative console log to show the sequence of commands
  that would typically be run.
