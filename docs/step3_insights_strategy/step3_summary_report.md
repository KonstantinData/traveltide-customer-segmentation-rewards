# TT-032 — Step 3 Summary Report (Insights + Recommendation Rationale)

This report consolidates the **Step 3 segment insights** and the **reasoning
behind the recommended perks/strategies**. It bridges the evidence signals from
Step 2 features to the action plan outlined in the strategy recommendations.

## Executive summary

- Five segments show distinct intent patterns across browsing depth, booking
  propensity, discount sensitivity, and cancellation risk.
- Recommendations align perks to **observable intent signals** to lift
  conversion and protect margin.
- Medium-confidence segments (0 and 4) require **iterative testing** and
  monitoring of conversion lift and cancellation rates.

## Segment insights (what we learned)

| Segment id | Persona | Core insight | Primary opportunity | Risk / watchout |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Explorer Planners | High research behavior, moderate conversion. | Nurture intent with planning tools to move from exploration to booking. | Over-incentivizing may erode margin without conversion lift. |
| 1 | Deal-Driven Flyers | Strong flight booking intent with high discount responsiveness. | Use targeted airfare promotions to accelerate flight conversion. | Promo fatigue if discounts are too frequent. |
| 2 | Staycation Bundlers | Hotel-first, longer stays, multi-room behavior. | Bundle hotel perks to increase length-of-stay and room upgrades. | Ensure perks don’t cannibalize full-price rooms. |
| 3 | Frequent Business Travelers | Frequent, short-stay travel with low discount dependence. | Speed + loyalty accelerators to reduce friction and reinforce retention. | Over-rewarding already-loyal customers without incremental lift. |
| 4 | Cautious Evaluators | High cancellation signals and low conversion. | Reduce perceived risk to increase booking confidence. | Flexible policies could increase cancellations if not monitored. |

## Recommendation rationale (why these perks)

The recommendations map **behavioral evidence → incentive fit**. Each segment’s
perk addresses its dominant friction:

- **Segment 0 (Explorer Planners)**: High browsing signals indicate planning
  friction; itinerary builders and price alerts support decision-making without
  heavy discounting.
- **Segment 1 (Deal-Driven Flyers)**: Discount sensitivity and flight-first
  behavior justify airfare promos or miles multipliers to capture intent at the
  point of price change.
- **Segment 2 (Staycation Bundlers)**: Longer stays and multi-room bookings
  respond to hotel/room value (free-night thresholds, upgrades), reinforcing
  lodging-first behavior.
- **Segment 3 (Frequent Business Travelers)**: High repeat behavior and short
  stays suggest time sensitivity; loyalty accelerators and priority flows reduce
  friction and strengthen retention.
- **Segment 4 (Cautious Evaluators)**: Elevated cancellation rates imply risk
  aversion; flexible cancellation and price guarantees reduce hesitation.

## Measurement focus (how to validate)

Track segment-specific KPI movement after rollout:

- **Conversion lift**: segment booking conversion, promo redemption rate.
- **Value uplift**: average nights/rooms (Segment 2), repeat booking rate
  (Segment 3).
- **Risk outcomes**: cancellation rate changes, especially for Segment 4.
